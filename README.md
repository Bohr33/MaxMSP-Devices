A Collection of Max Patchers and Max for Live Devices
This is a collection of various Max Patches and Max for Live devices I've made. Many of these are an attempt for me to 'modularize' ableton by creating
signals that can be mapped to Live parameters. Others are just some cool ideas I had. Enjoy!

To download, click the green 'Code' button in the top right and download the zip. After unzipping, in the file browser go to Ableton > User Library > Presets. From there, you will have to place each device into their respective Intstrument, Audio Effect, or MIDI Effect catagory and put them in the Max for Live section of that effect type. From there they should be visible within Ableton.
